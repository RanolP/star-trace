# star-trace

Trace the stars: some may fall, some may be recalled, and some may remain as you thought.

## The Idea

We star repositories. But we don't recall most of them again.
As of now we can classify repositories for easier search.
But it's not enough; we should minimize the index for reduce overwhelming.

star-trace will introduce a way to solve this problem: star blowing.
This service makes you to recall a starred repository for revalidation.
If you think that's worse than you thought now,
just blow up the star, with optional observation that may useful when you see the repository again.
